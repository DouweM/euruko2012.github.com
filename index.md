# EuRuKo is an annual conference about the Ruby language with an informal atmosphere and lots of opportunities to listen, to talk, to hack and to have fun.

Amsterdam and Ruby have a lot in common: they're both laidback, straight-forward, no-frills pieces of heaven. Amsterdam is also smack in the middle of Europe, and thus the perfect choice for a European Ruby Conference.
We are starting ticket sales and will be announcing our first speakers soon so be sure to check back regularly and [follow us](http://twitter.com/euruko) on Twitter!</p>
