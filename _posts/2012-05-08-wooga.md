We're proud of having Wooga on board. Wooga is the second largest social games developer worldwide and was founded in 2009, and the company has quickly grown to over 70 employees from 20 different countries. They have around 35 million active players per month. Wooga develops social games for Facebook, Google+ and iOS with a focus on emotional character development, usability and superb localization in seven languages. Using cutting-edge technologies they create games for players of all ages. 

Diamond Dash is Woogaâ€™s fifth game, preceded by Brain Buddies, Bubble Island, Monster World and Happy Hospital.

Also Wooga's crew has had nice talks at conferences before. Check out Tim Lossen's fight at Wroclove.rb ["JRuby vs. Rubinius (Fight)"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=AYYGage3B-I)

And if you want to join the crew, just ping someone at the conference or just visit [http://www.wooga.com/jobs/](http://www.wooga.com/jobs/)
