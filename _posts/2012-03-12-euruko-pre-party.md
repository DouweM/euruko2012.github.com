We've got some more awesome news for you!

This year we wanted to do something special, something not seen at any other EuRuKo, and what else would you expect in such a wonderful city like Amsterdam.

After a lot of brainstorming we came up with a great idea!

One of the things which Amsterdam is famous for is our lovely canals, so why not give you all the oppurtunity to enjoy this on the best way possible?! We know how : while drinking great Dutch beer!

That's right, this year's EuRuKo pre party will be on the lovely canals of Amsterdam! And the best part is, the drinks will be sponsored by GitHub!!

### How to attend

Tickets will cost 15 EUR for the two hour cruise, and it is important for us to know numbers in advance, so instead of dealing with money and tickets on the night, you can instead reserve a spot when buying your conference ticket.

And just a reminder, the first batch of tickets will go on sale **TOMORROW**!

Hope to see you on board!

The EuRuKo Team
