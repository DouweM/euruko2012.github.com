OMG IT'S EuRuKo WEEK!!

What is a awesome conference without an awesome app to keep you up-to-date?!?!

We are super happy to announce the EuRuKo 2012 iOS and Android app, created by the fantastic folks at [Applicake](http://applicake.com).

The EuRuKo App will send you the latest news, agenda changes, party locations and fantastic local tips for things to do around Amsterdam.

You can find the app in the [App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/euruko/id529120655) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.applicake.conferenceapp). And don't be worried when the app requests permission for push notifications, we'll use those to keep you up to date during the conference.

And again, a huge THANKS to our special friends at [Applicake](http://applicake.com) for providing us with this awesome addition to our awesome conference!

See you at the Hack Day / Boat Party / Conference.

Thijs and The EuRuKo Team
