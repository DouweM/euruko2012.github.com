### Ticketing update
On Tuesday night something great happend, all 150 tickets from the first
batch pretty much went flying out the door within 60 seconds!

You might not have known though that Amiando releases non-sold reserved
tickets after 15 minutes, so if a purchase isn't complete then the
ticket is released back into the pool. The main point to note is that
"All tickets have been reserved" does not mean the tickets are sold out
yet :)

Ever wondered what the trafic looks like when hundreds of people are
going 
crazy pressing the refresh button? Good news, Patrick HÃ¼sler from EuRuKo
2011 
set up Hummingbird for us and recorded everything! Check it out:

### Boat party tickets
As if we didn't already know, the boat party is going to be fantastic!
Almost all attendees bought a boat party ticket so you don't want to
miss this! And of course, all drinks will be sponsored by our amazing
friends at GitHub!

Several people who didn't select the boat party ticket option, or
something went wrong during the checkout process, have already contacted
us asking to get a reservation sorted out. Don't worry, we will
get you tickets, we will have more news about this next Friday (23rd of
March). For now, sit tight and relax, we won't forget you :)

We have also had a few emails asking if there is room for partners on
the canal cruise, this is yet to be determined and we hope to know more
after the next batch of tickets go on sale. We can not promise anything,
and we ask for patience on this matter as there is still a lot to sort
out.

As for the time the boat will depart, it will be between 6pm and 9pm.
This isn't set in stone, but if you are planning flights make
sure you arrive with time to spare.

This also brings us to another important point, there are plans for a
hack 
day on the Thursday, more details to come in the next couple of weeks,
but
we thought we should tell you now before it is too late ;)

### Next ticket batch sale
Better cancel your soccer training, girls night out or dinner with your
partner because the next batch of tickets will be released on
**Wednesday
the 28th of March at 8pm CEST**. Lets try to set a new record this
time and sell out in 30 seconds ;)

We can't wait to see you all in Amsterdam!
