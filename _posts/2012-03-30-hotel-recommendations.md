So after hitting refresh for 10 minutes you snagged yourself a ticket to EuRuKo, and now you are thinking: “How should I get there? Where should I stay? What should I wear?”, well, we can't answer all of those questions for you, but we can recommend some great places to stay while you are in town :)

## Hostels

Trying to do Amsterdam on the cheap and still have a great experience? Check out one of the hostels below.

Hostels are also great because you can get 6 person rooms for you and all your friends to stay in. And really, how long are you actually going to be sleeping for?

### [Stayokay Vondelpark](http://www.stayokay.com/amsterdam)
Close to the conference venue but also very popular so get it while there are still rooms available!

### [Stayokay Zeeburg](http://www.stayokay.com/zeeburg)
Another great hostel, but a little out of the centre of Amsterdam so not as busy.

Direct connection with the conference venue via tram 14.

## Hotels

Want a more private sleeping arrangement? Or maybe your better half is going to come to Amsterdam with you? We have some Hotel picks for you then, or check out [ebooking](http://www.ebooking.com/en/destinations/hotels-in/amsterdam) for a full list (with some reviews of course).

### [Hans Brinker Budget Hotel](http://www.hans-brinker.com/)
Inexpensive and walking distance distance from the conference venue.

### [DoubleTree by Hilton](http://doubletree1.hilton.com/en_US/dt/hotel/AMSCSDI-DoubleTree-by-Hilton-Hotel-Amsterdam-Centraal-Station-/index.do)
Expensive but great location next to Amsterdam's Central Station

### [NH Hotels](http://www.nh-hotels.com/nh/en/hotels/the-netherlands/amsterdam.html)
Expensive but NH has a couple hotels crawling distance from the conference venue


## Alternative

Dutch architecture is great to look at, but why not stay in it as well?

Maybe you are looking for a house boat, or an apartment for you and some friends to stay in, or a nice place in the Jordaan for you and your family? Whatever the case, or whatever the price range, [Airbnb](http://airbnb.com) has got you covered!

Happy booking!
The EuRuKo team
