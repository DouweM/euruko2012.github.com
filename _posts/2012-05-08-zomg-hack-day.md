Hey Everyone,

First off, HAPPY TUESDAY!!

We are very excited to announce that on Thursday the 31st of May, the day before EuRuKo kicks off, we're organising a hack day for anyone and everyone to attend, even if you can't make it to EuRuKo itself! Join us to hack on your favorite open-source project or another fun/useful/yakshaving endeavour.

Have no idea where to start? Don' worry, some awesome people will be present to help you along: [Jon Leighton](http://jonathanleighton.com/) (Rails core), [Xavier Nora](http://hashref.com/) (Rails core), [Charles Nutter](http://headius.blogspot.com/) (JRuby core), [Brian Ford](http://brixen.io/) (Rubinius core) and [Terence Lee](https://twitter.com/#!/hone02) (Bundler core).

This is all being made possible by the fantastic sponsorship by Heroku. Many thanks and lots of high-5s to them!

The day will start at 10am and end around 4pm. The venue is in the process of being confirmed, but will be in the centre of Amsterdam. We will provider coffee, water, soft-drinks, snacks, and the all important lunch during the day.

The number of spots is limited, so be quick! You can [register for the hack day here](http://eurukohackday.eventbrite.com/).

Hope to see you at the hack day!

The EuRuKo Team
