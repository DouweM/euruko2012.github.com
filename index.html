      <h1>EuRuKo is an annual conference about the Ruby language with an informal atmosphere and lots of oppurtunities to listen, to talk, to hack and to have fun.</h1>
      <p>Amsterdam and Ruby have a lot in common: they're both laidback, straight-forward, no-frills pieces of heaven. Amsterdam is also smack in the middle of Europe, and thus the perfect choice for a European Ruby Conference. We are starting ticket sales and will be announcing our first speakers soon so be sure to check back regularly and <a href="http://twitter.com/euruko">follow us</a> on Twitter!</p>
