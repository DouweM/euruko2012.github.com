      <h1>EuRuKo is an annual conference about the Ruby language with an informal atmosphere and lots of opportunities to listen, to talk, to hack and to have fun.</h1>
      <p>Amsterdam and Ruby have a lot in common: they're both laidback, straight-forward, no-frills pieces of heaven. Amsterdam is also smack in the middle of Europe, and thus the perfect choice for a European Ruby Conference. We are starting ticket sales and will be announcing our first speakers soon so be sure to check back regularly and <a href="http://twitter.com/euruko">follow us</a> on Twitter!</p>

          <h1>Pathé Tuschinski</h1>
          <p>The conference will be held in Pathé Tuschinski, a movie theatre in the heart of Amsterdam. Built in 1921 by its namesake Abraham Icek Tuschinski, the Hijman Louis de Jong-designed building is a spectacular mix of architectural styles: Amsterdam School, Jugendstil, Art Nouveau and Art Deco. The main auditorium usually plays host to movie premieres in the Netherlands, and is considered one of the most beautiful cinemas in the world.</p>

          <h1>Call for proposals</h1>
          <p>Have a great idea for a talk? Do you have passion bursting out your ears? Want to sing to the world about a better way to use Ruby? Then why not submit a talk!</p>
          <p>We love talk ideas of all shapes and sizes, but if you need a little inspiration maybe think about 'using Ruby as a glue'.<br>This is open to interpretation and we are looking forward to seeing the many ideas you come up with :)</p>
